# This file tells about FalconXOS-Yuki(codename : 'White Fox')

Yuki is one of the most important components of FalconXOS.
<br>
The best thing about Yuki is that it is universal
<br>
While the runner works only FalconXOS's UFT(User-Friendly Terminal), the renderer works for the entire FalconXOS, including all components.
<br>
It is used to run FalconXOS and will be used to render advanced images.
<br>
Yuki is in developement and is one of the components of FalconXOS which might take some time.
<br>
Also FalconXOS-Yuki is not to be confused with Operating Shell
<br>
Both of them are completely different
Also Yuki will be included in the main FalconXOS repository after some of the main parts are added.
<br>
<br>
The code of this repository and the implementation of Yuki in FalconXOS will be a little different but will be somewhat same
