  It's just that everyone should know who has created or helped making this commit

It is optional to write your email when signing
When making a pull request, it is recommended to follow the format of the pull request.You must also follow contributing guidelines which are listed below

### Contributing guidelines

### Some other guidelines

There aren't really any other guidelines, the main thing is that you should follow the contributing guidelines and if there are any other things you want to add you can tell me by opening a new pull request or issue

## If you are contributing documentation

The same contributing guidelines should be followed for fixing and adding documentation.
  <br>
Try to make the contribution which you are making as clear as possible by pointing them in the pull request.
You can write something like:
<br>

Although this is optional and you can make the changes visible by following any format of your choice

### How to contribute
  
You can create a new pull request or add a new issue if you have found a new issue.
