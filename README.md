### About Yuki
  
  Yuki(also known as FalconXOS-Yuki)is an in-developement component of FalconXOS which will be used to run and render graphics in FalconXOS.
  <br>
  It is the most important component of FalconXOS,as it is universal and will be used for both FalconXOS's UFT(User-Friendly Terminal)and FalconXOS's Operating Shell(which will be released at a later version of FalconXOS).
  <br>
  Yuki, although is a FalconXOS component, can also be used for your projects.
  <br>
  If you want a cool shell-type runner, Yuki can do that.
  <br>
  If you want a renderer which can render graphics, Yuki can do that also.
  <br>
  <br>
  Note : By renderer doesn't mean that you can give Yuki a huge unreal engine project and it will render the entire project for you.
  <br>
  Yuki will be designed with FalconXOS and its functionality in mind but it can be used as a renderer to render, for example a video or play a video or give it a .png and it will display it.
